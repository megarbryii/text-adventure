            <p>This is an old fashioned text adventure game where you are trying to escape a county jail cell and 
                make a break for freedom.
            </p>

            <p>The instructions are simple... You just click on the button for the option that you want to perform
                (such as going a direction or picking up an item) and just keep going until you make it to the end
                or until something bad happens to you.
            </p>

            <p>Good luck!  And have fun escaping your prison!</p>
